I work on **algorithms, cryptography, and geometry**. <br>
I primarily use C, C++, Python, Rust, Java, and Go. <br>
I also **tutor** and produce materials for these using LaTeX, PGF, and TikZ. <br>

I don't like coding, I love [theoretical computer science](https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/theoretical-computer-science). I am sadly, stuck doing coding. <br>
Unlike, majority of the computer science population, _I am not an aspiring software engineer_.

Projects I am currently working on:
- [Raytracer](https://github.com/zrygan/raytracer)
- [Persistent Data Structures](https://github.com/zrygan/tt/tree/main/DSA%202/Data%20Structures)

Things I am learning right now:
- Bioinformatics
- Cryptography

Here are my best projects:
- [Raytracer](https://github.com/zrygan/raytracer)
- [The tt](https://github.com/zrygan/tt)
- Case Study on Tagalog and Bikol languages using theory of computation. [Paper](https://github.com/zrygan/Filipino-Case-Study), [Source](https://github.com/zrygan/LanguageTool-Case-Study)
