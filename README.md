Personal Website and Blog: [`zrygan.github.io`](https://zrygan.github.io/)  

I work on **algorithms, programming language theory, and theory of computation**. <br>
and how we can use techniques from these in computational linguistics. <br>
I primarily use Rust, Go, Python, and Ocaml. <br>

Unlike, majority of the computer science population, _I am not an aspiring software engineer_.
