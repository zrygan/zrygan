### **Zhean Ganituen** / `zrygan`

Personal: `zr<dot>gntn<at>gmail<dot>com` <br>
Academic: `zhean_robby_ganituen<at>dlsu<dot>edu<dot>ph` <br>
Personal Website and Blog: [`zrygan.github.io`](https://zrygan.github.io/)  

I work on **algorithms, cryptography, geometry and graphics**. <br>
I primarily use C, C++, Python, Rust, Java, and Go. <br>
I also **tutor** and produce materials for these using LaTeX, PGF, and TikZ. <br>

Unlike, majority of the computer science population, _I am not an aspiring software engineer_.

Projects I am currently working on:

- [Symbolang](https://github.com/zrygan/symbolang)

I am also currently working on my undergraduate thesis. See [this organization](https://github.com/Mango-Cats).

Things I am learning right now:
- Quantum Computation and Information
- Cryptography
- Programming Language Theory

My best projects are:
- [Raytracer](https://github.com/zrygan/raytracer)
- Case Study on Tagalog and Bikol languages using theory of computation. [Paper](https://github.com/zrygan/Filipino-Case-Study), [Source](https://github.com/zrygan/LanguageTool-Case-Study). This work is also (to be) presented at IEEE International Symposium on Technology and Society ([ISTAS](https://attend.ieee.org/istas-2025/)) at Santa Clara University.
- Semantic and Orthographic Drug Similarity by unsupervised learning and bigram similarity. [`SemanticDrugSim`](https://github.com/Mango-Cats/SemanticDrugSim)
